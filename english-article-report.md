The article I’m going to speak about is taken from journal Combinatorica. It was published in 1981. The title of article is "Intersection theorems with geometric consequences". The authors are Frankl and Wilson. The first part of article is devoted to prooving a theorem about maximum number of subsets that has a paticular kind of intersection. At the second part the authors apply this theorem for finding an estimation for chromatic number of multi-dimensional space and proving the fact that this chromatic number has a lower bound with exponential growth depending on a number of space dimensions.

The article begins with a description of terms required to formulate the theorem. First of all the author describes that we have a set from natural numbers size of n. Then introduce k-element subsets from this set. These k-element subsets has an intersection with each other, and the size of intersections must have a particular value. After that the author gives a short overview an already known estimation for maximum number of k-element subsets given earlier. The definition of main theorem is presented. It is mentioned that the new theorem is generalized earlir know facts and gives more consices estimation.

The article Iâ€™m going to speak about is taken from journal Combinatorica. It was published in 1981. The title of article is "Intersection theorems with geometric consequences". The authors are Frankl and Wilson. The first part of article is devoted to proving a theorem about maximum number of subsets that has a particular kind of intersection. At the second part the authors apply this theorem for finding an estimation for chromatic number of multi-dimensional space and proving the fact that this chromatic number has a lower bound with exponential growth depending on a number of space dimensions.

The article begins with a description of terms required to formulate the theorem. First of all the author describes that we have a set from natural numbers size of n. Then introduce k-element subsets from this set. These k-element subsets has an intersection with each other, and the size of intersections must have a particular value. After that the author gives a short overview an already known estimation for maximum number of k-element subsets given earlier.

After that the author outlines the article content:
- It is formulated the main theorem without a proof. It is mentioned that the new theorem is generalization earlier known facts;
- Then corollaries are listed that follow from the theorem;
- Next, it is introduced a statement for chromatic number of multi-dimensional space;
- And finally presented a generalization of the first theorem;

In the main part of article the author provides the proof for the theorem and all secondary statements. By the way the author introduces an additional lemma. The proof uses facts from linear algebra and some facts from a number theory. The article is ended by proving an extension of the theorem: it gives an estimation for the case when the k-element subsets intersects in a special way. Their intersections must form a collection of distinct residues with module q which is a prime number. At the same time the size of the subsets by module q is not contained in the collections residues. In this situation we get a much better estimation for the maximum number of subsets.
